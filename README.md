## ✨ What is emcalc?

**emcalc** is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to calculate energy from mass using Einstein's famous formula:  
\[
E = mc^2
\]

But it doesn’t stop there:

- 🎛️ **Presets** for common nuclear power plants
- 📟 **Minimal**, **CLI**, and **interactive** modes included  
- 🧠 **Educational**: Great for students, teachers, and science lovers  
- 🛠️ **Open Source** and licensed under **GNU GPLv3**
